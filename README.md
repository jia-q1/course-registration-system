# Course Registration System (CRS)  

## Overview  
The **Course Registration System (CRS)** is a Java-based application designed to manage course registrations for a university. The system enables administrators to oversee course and student data and provides students with tools to register for and withdraw from courses. The CRS ensures data persistence using serialization and offers a modular, object-oriented design for scalability and maintainability.
